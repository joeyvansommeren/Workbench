# Shell (new interface)

The window root shown when `AgentHubDefaults.appleShellEnabled` is on at launch.
`AgentHubApp` reads the flag once, so the root, menus and window style are fixed
until relaunch. With the flag off, `AgentHubOperationsView` runs unchanged.

## Slots

`ShellFrame(sidebar:toolbar:detail:)` lays out three slots. Each phase replaces
only its own slot:

| Slot | View | Replaced by |
|---|---|---|
| sidebar | `ShellSidebarContainer` (nav rows + `ShellPlaceholderSessionList`) | P5 |
| toolbar | `ShellToolbar` (`ShellSessionsToolbarContent` / titles / search) | P6 tabs, P8, P9 |
| detail | `ShellDetailSlot` (one `case` per destination) | P6 Sessions, P8 Reviews, P9 Sprint |

Per-window state lives in `ShellRoot`: `WorkbenchShellModel`,
`SessionNavigationModel` and `SessionsActionCoordinator` (environment-injected,
never provider singletons). Menu commands reach the key window through
`FocusedValues.workbenchShell`.

## Title bar spike (2026-11-13): Variant B

Measured in an AppKit test host on macOS 27.

- **Variant A (real `NSToolbar` items) failed.** The toolbar gives the right
  chrome (52 pt bar, traffic lights at x 19, y 19), but items do not align with
  the content column: the gaps between items change with state (12, 8, 20 pt), at
  900 pt wide the spacer item jumps before the toggle, and an item with
  `maxWidth: .infinity` stays at its minimum, so P6's tab strip cannot fill.
- **Variant B (chosen).** `.hiddenTitleBar` window (as legacy), no toolbar items,
  safe-area top is 0, and the shell draws its own 52 pt row. Nothing ignores the
  top safe area except backgrounds. `TitleBarDragArea` gives the empty row drag
  and double-click (it honours `AppleActionOnDoubleClick`).
- **Known gap.** Without a toolbar the system title bar is 32 pt, so the traffic
  lights sit at x 9, y 9, not centred in the 52 pt row as in the prototype.
  Moving them needs AppKit frame changes on every layout, which is a layout-loop
  risk, so they stay.

## Layout-loop rules

No `NavigationSplitView`, `HSplitView`, `VSplitView` or `.inspector` in shell
code. No `GeometryReader` widths. The sidebar collapses as a plain `HStack`
child. `ShellLayout.windowMinWidth` is 1040 while the legacy Reviews
`HSplitView` (731 pt minimum) is hosted. Lower it to 900 after P8.
